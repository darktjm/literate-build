This is my literate programming support package.  Its main purpose is
to provide syntax highlighting in multiple source languages using
NoWeb, GNU make, and a number of other freely available packages.  It
can be configured to use one of several different highlighting
packages (listings, GNU source-highlight, Andr√© Simon's highlight),
and can produce PDF and HTML output in several different ways
(pdflatex, xelatex, noweb-l2h, tex4ht).  It also has several hacks to make
literate C code easier.

Producing the PDF and HTML output from scratch is trivial if all of
the prerequisites are met, but rather than forcing you to read the
NoWeb source to find out those prerequisites, I have provided the PDF
and HTML output as well.  One of these is all you need, since they have
the source attached (and have instructions for detaching).

I have split out the basic user documentation into its own file,
build-doc.{nw,pdf,html}.  You can just download that instead.  The PDF
and HTML versions have both their own source and build.nw attached, so
no further downloads are required.

For details, see http://darkalpha.homelinux.org/literate/.  That page
has a complete summary of the history of this project, including some
much older versions of the build system.

Don't bother with ada-build.nw, since it is a work in progress
abandoned years ago.  It does work with some of my old Ada sources,
but is mostly a non-functional repository for my old version 1 and 2
code.  The only reason it's here is that this is a mirror of my SVN
build directory, where that happens to reside.
