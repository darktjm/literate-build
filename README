This is my literate programming support package.  Its main purpose is
to provide syntax highlighting in multiple languages using NoWeb.  It
can be configured to use one of several different highlighting
packages, and can produce PDF and HTML output in several different
ways.  At the minimum, it requires GNU make.

Producing the PDF and HTML output from scratch is trivial if all of
the prerequisites are met, but rather than forcing you to read the
NoWeb source find out those prerequisites, I have provided the PDF and
HTML output as well.  One of these is all you need, since they have
the source attached (and have instructions for detaching).

For details, I have an older version up at
http://darkalpha.homelinux.org/literate/ with versions 1 and 2 (this
is version 3+).  That page has a complete summary of the history of
this project.  The "latest code" mentioned there is the last code I
uploaded to that server, over a year ago.  Right now, that server is
1000 miles away and without remote shell access, so it will be a while
before I updated it again.  The version here on GitHub is the most
recent.

Don't bother with ada-build.nw, since it is a work in progress
abandoned years ago.  It does work with some of my old Ada sources,
but is mostly a non-functional repository for my old version 1 and 2
clode.
