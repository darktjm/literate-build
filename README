This is my literate programming support package.  Converting it to
PDF/HTML is non-trivial (easy to do, but lots of prerequisites), so I
have provided the PDF and HTML output as well.  One of these is all you
need, since they have the source attached (and have instructions for
detaching).  Don't bother with ada-build.nw, since it is a work in
progress abandoned years ago.

For details, I have an older version up at
http://darkalpha.homelinux.org/literate/ with versions 1 and 2 (this
is version 3+).
